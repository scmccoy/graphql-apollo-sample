GraphQL debugging tools for Apollo Client in the Chrome developer console.
Apollo Client Developer Tools is a Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source JavaScript GraphQL client, Apollo Client. The extension has 3 main features:

1. A built-in GraphiQL console that allows you to make queries against your GraphQL server using your app's network interface directly (no configuration necessary).

2. A query watcher that shows you which queries are being watched by the current page, when those queries are loading, and what variables those queries are using.

3. A mutation inspector that displays the mutations made to you apollo-client app data.

4. A cache inspector that displays your client-side Redux store in an Apollo-Client-friendly way. You can explore the state of the store through a tree-like interface, and search through the store for specific field keys and values.

The extension will work with Apollo Client versions 0.5.18 and above! You can learn more about Apollo Client for GraphQL from these resources:
